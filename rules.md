# Save Atlantis

## Part Requirements

* A set of Save Atlantis cards. (A standard 52 card deck can be substituted for this)
* A power die, perhaps a six sided die, for each player.
* A token for each player. (a minertature figurine or a beer bottle cap)
* 2 to 4 players.

## Game Setup

1. Shuffle the deck.
1. Each player draws five cards.
1. Place a single card face down on the table.
1. Each player chooses and places a token on top of the face down card.
1. Each player takes a power die and places it down with the value 6.

## Gameplay

The goal of the game is to be the last one in the game.

If your power die reaches zero (e.g. you have one power, and must reduce it) you are removed from the game.

1. Each player takes turns, starting with the cutest. (You may fight amongst yourselves over this qualifier)
1. At the start of your turn:
  a. reduce your power die by one.
  b. draw a card into your hand.
  c. draw a card without looking at it, and place it adjacent to any card on the table. (Your card must be able to fit on the table. If you only have room for one card, consider finding a larger table, you nut.)
1. During your turn you may:
  a. move to an adjacent card that is face down. For every move you make, reduce your power die by one. (You must have two or more power to move.) Flip that card rightside up and activate it (follow the instructions on the card). 
  b. Play any card from your hand. Any card played may be countered (or nullified) if anyone else plays a card with a higher value. (Face cards cannot be countered).

## Gameplay without Save Atlantis cards

__These instructions are if you only have a standard 52 card deck__

If you activate a:
* diamond (a recharge card), recharge your power die up to two.
* spade (a bomb card), you may destroy any card on the table that does not have a player on it.
* heart (a build card), you must draw a card, and place it face down somewhere on the table adjacent to another card.
* club (a vision card), you may personally reveal a face down card to yourself. You can choose to flip that card face up. If you do, it does not activate.

Aces are low.

If you land on a face card, you must discard a card. If that card is a face card, you draw two cards and activate the face card's suit twice.
